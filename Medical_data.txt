A 75-year-old man was brought to the hospital with an episode of dizziness. He still felt unwell when he was seen 30 minutes after the onset. He was well until the last 6 months, since when he has had some falls irregularly. On some occasions, he lost consciousness and is unsure how long he has been unconscious. On a few occasions, he has fallen, grazing his knees, and on others, he has felt dizzy and has had to sit down but has not lost consciousness. These episodes usually happened on exertion, but once or twice they have occurred while sitting down. He recovers over 10–15 minutes after each episode. He lives alone and most of the episodes have not been witnessed. Once his granddaughter was with him when he blacked out. Worried, she called an ambulance. He looked so pale and still that she thought that he had died. He was taken to the hospital, by which time he had recovered completely and was discharged and told that he had a normal electrocardiogram (ECG) and chest X-ray. There is no history of chest pain or palpitations. He has had gout and some urinary frequency. A diagnosis of benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) has been made for which he is not on treatment. He takes ibuprofen occasionally for the gout. He stopped smoking 5 years ago. He drinks 5–10 units of alcohol weekly. The dizziness and blackouts have not been associated with alcohol. There is no relevant family history. He used to work as an electrician. He is pale with a blood pressure of 96/64 mmHg. The pulse rate is 33/min, regular. There are no heart murmurs. The jugular venous pressure is raised 3 cm with occasional rises. There is no leg edema; the peripheral pulses are palpable except for the left dorsalis pedis. The respiratory system is normal.


A 34-year-old male accountant comes to the emergency department with acute chest pain. There is a previous history of occasional stabbing chest pain for 2 years. The current pain had come on 4 h earlier at 8 pm and has been persistent since then. It is central in position, with some radiation to both sides of the chest. It is not associated with shortness of breath or palpitations. The pain is relieved by sitting up and leaning forward. Two paracetamol tablets taken earlier at 9 pm did not make any difference to the pain. The previous chest pain had been occasional, lasting a second or two at a time and with no particular precipitating factors. It has usually been on the left side of the chest although the position had varied. Two weeks previously he had an upper respiratory tract infection which lasted 4 days. This consisted of a sore throat, blocked nose, sneezing, and a cough. His wife and two children were ill at the same time with similar symptoms but have been well since then. He has a history of migraine. In the family history, his father had a myocardial infarction at the age of 51 years and was found to have a marginally high cholesterol level. His mother and two sisters, aged 36 and 38 years, are well. After his father’s infarct, he had his lipids measured; the cholesterol was 5.1 mmol/L (desirable range/H110215). He is a non-smoker who drinks 15 units of alcohol per week. His pulse rate is 75/min, blood pressure 124/78 mmHg. His temperature is 37°C. There is nothing abnormal to find in the cardiovascular and respiratory systems. A chest X-ray is normal. The hemoglobin and white cell count are normal. The creatine kinase level is slightly raised. Other biochemical tests are normal.


A 19-year-old boy has a history of repeated chest infections. He had problems with a cough and sputum production in the first 2 years of life and was labelled as bronchitic. Over the next 14 years he was often ‘chesty’ and had spent 4–5 weeks a year away from school. Over the past 2 years he has developed more problems and was admitted to hospital on three occasions with cough and purulent sputum. On the first two occasions, Haemophilus influenzae was grown on culture of the sputum, and on the last occasion 2 months previously Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated from the sputum at the time of admission to hospital. He is still coughing up sputum. Although he has largely recovered from the infection, his mother is worried and asked for a further sputum to be sent off. The report has come back from the microbiology laboratory showing that there is a scanty growth of Pseudomonas on culture of the sputum. There is no family history of any chest disease. Routine questioning shows that his appetite is reasonable, micturition is normal and his bowels tend to be irregular. On examination he is thin, weighing 48 kg and 1.6 m (5 ft 6 in) tall. The only finding in the chest is of a few inspiratory crackles over the upper zones of both lungs. Cardiovascular and abdominal examination is normal.
